# Green Piano - Demo App. 
## Green Piano is a simple Android application built to demonstrate audio playback and pitch manipulation using a single sound sample. 
The app features a green-themed user interface with two utility buttons and a one-octave piano keyboard (C to B). A base piano sound is stored in the res/raw directory and played using MediaPlayer for the default sound button, while SoundPool is used to generate different piano notes by dynamically adjusting the playback rate for each key. This approach mimics real piano notes using equal-temperament tuning without requiring multiple audio files. The project highlights Android activity lifecycle management, efficient audio resource handling, and modern UI design practices, making it suitable as a learning exercise or reference for sound-based Android applications.
